Purpose: Find malware persistence by examining common mechanisms across a network

Data Required: List of programs configured to start at boot/logon time on each endpoint

MS Sysinternals' autorunsc.exe is the most common way to collect this from a host

Analysis Techniques: Stack counting, string matching, outlier detection

Description

Gather autoruns data from endpoints across the network and look for:

Executable starting out of c:programdata, recycle bin, appdata area, %temp%
Unsigned executables
Shortest / longest filenames9ex-r.exe,1.bat)
GUID filenames
Rare executable filenames or directories
