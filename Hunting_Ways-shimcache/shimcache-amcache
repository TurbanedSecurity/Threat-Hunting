shimcache is a book keeping data that windows automatically keep to support application  compatibility and is used by xp to 7 and server 2003-2008

It would tell what ran on a system over an extended period of time.
It would tell what dll's ,exe's were run.
it provides last modified  time stamp and location from where the ex's were run.

Amcache was a replacement of shimcache from windows 8 and server 2012
It also provide sha-1 hashes.It contains more fields then shimcache that can be of value in threat hunting.
